            <h2 id="tos-overview">Welcome</h2>
            <p>
                Secrecy enables you to securely encrypt and share content through end-to-end encryption, 
                giving you full control over your privacy. We're happy you're here.
            </p>
                <p>
                    These terms set forth our legal obligations to each other. They apply to your use of our services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we say <strong>"Secrecy," "we," "us," and "our"</strong> in these terms, we mean the Secrecy 
                    application, its developers, and its related services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we say <strong>"services"</strong> in these terms, we mean Secrecy's mobile application, 
                    features, encryption services, user directory, and other related products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we say <strong>"you"</strong> or <strong>"your,"</strong> we mean you, the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also have a <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> and other policies that apply to your use of our 
                    services and are incorporated into these terms. You should read these policies—we have worked hard 
                    to make them simple and clear, and they contain important information about your use of our 
                    services. By using Secrecy's services, you agree to these terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Together, these rules make Secrecy possible, and they matter to us. If you believe others aren't 
                    following them, please let us know by contacting us.
                </p>

            <h2 id="acceptance">Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>
                By downloading, installing, or using Secrecy, you agree to be bound by these Terms of 
                Service. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the app. These terms constitute a 
                legally binding agreement between you and Secrecy. You must be at least 13 years old to use 
                this app. By using the app, you represent that you have the legal capacity to enter into this 
                agreement.

            <h3 id="account-creation">Account Creation</h3>
            <p>
                You must provide accurate and complete information when creating an account. You are responsible 
                for maintaining the security of your account credentials. You must notify us immediately of any 
                unauthorized access to your account. One person or legal entity may not maintain more than one 
                account.
            </p>

            <h3 id="account-security">Account Security</h3>
            <p>
                You are solely responsible for all activities under your account. Your private keys are stored on 
                your device and are your responsibility. We cannot recover your data if you lose your private 
                keys. Never share your private keys or account credentials with anyone.
            </p>

            <h2 id="acceptable-use">Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
            <p>
                You agree NOT to use Secrecy for any illegal activities or purposes, violating any applicable laws 
                or regulations, harassing, threatening, or harming others, distributing malware, viruses, or harmful 
                code, attempting to gain unauthorized access to our systems, interfering with or disrupting the app's 
                functionality, impersonating others or misrepresenting your identity, collecting or harvesting user 
                information without consent, or circumventing security features or encryption mechanisms.
            </p>

            <h2 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
            
            <h3 id="ip-our-rights">Our Rights</h3>
            <p>
                Secrecy and all its content, features, and functionality are owned by us. The Secrecy name, logo, 
                and trademarks are our property. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or reverse engineer the app. 
                All rights not expressly granted are reserved.
            </p>

            <h3 id="ip-your-content">Your Content</h3>
            <p>
                You retain all rights to your encrypted content. Your encrypted secrets remain your property. We do 
                not claim ownership of your data. You are responsible for the legality of content you encrypt and 
                share.
            </p>

            <h2 id="disclaimers">Disclaimers and Warranties</h2>
            
            <p>
                <strong>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                We disclaim all warranties, express or implied. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free 
                service. While we use industry-standard encryption, no system is completely secure. If you lose 
                your private keys, we cannot recover your data. We do not guarantee that the app will meet all 
                your requirements. The app may not work on all devices or operating systems.
            </p>

            <h3 id="encryption-limitations">Encryption Limitations</h3>
            <p>
                Encryption is a technical process and may have vulnerabilities. We cannot guarantee that encrypted 
                content is absolutely unbreakable. You are responsible for choosing strong passwords and securing 
                your device. Loss of private keys results in permanent loss of encrypted data.
            </p>

            <h2 id="limitation-liability">Limitation of Liability</h2>
            
            <p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:</strong></p>
            <p>
                We shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. 
                We are not liable for any loss of data, profits, or business opportunities. We are not liable for 
                unauthorized access to your device or account. We are not liable for content shared through external 
                apps. As this is a free app, our total liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
            </p>

            <h3 id="data-loss">Data Loss</h3>
            <p>
                You are responsible for backing up your important data. We are not responsible for data loss due to 
                device failure, loss, or theft. We cannot recover lost private keys or encrypted content.
            </p>

            <h2 id="termination">Account Termination</h2>
            
            <h3 id="termination-you">Termination by You</h3>
            <p>
                You may delete your account at any time through the app. Account deletion will remove all your 
                server-stored data within 30 days. Data on your device must be deleted manually or by uninstalling 
                the app.
            </p>

            <h3 id="termination-us">Termination by Us</h3>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms of Service, 
                you engage in illegal activities, you abuse the app or harm other users, your account poses a 
                security risk, or if required by law or legal process.
            </p>

            <h3 id="termination-effect">Effect of Termination</h3>
            <p>
                Upon termination, your right to use the app ceases immediately. Server-stored data will be deleted 
                according to our retention policy. You remain responsible for activities that occurred during your 
                use. Provisions that should survive termination will continue to apply.
            </p>

            <h2 id="governing-law">Governing Law and Disputes</h2>
            
            <h3 id="law-governing">Governing Law</h3>
            <p>
                These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of your country of 
                residence, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising from these Terms 
                or your use of the app shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in your country 
                of residence. By using Secrecy, you consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts.
            </p>

            <h3 id="dispute-resolution">Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>
                In the event of a dispute, you agree to first attempt informal resolution by contacting us. If 
                informal resolution fails, disputes may be resolved through arbitration or court proceedings. You 
                agree to waive any right to a jury trial.
            </p>

            <h2 id="tos-changes">Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>
                We may modify these Terms of Service at any time. We will notify you of material changes by updating 
                the "Last updated" date at the top of this document, sending an in-app notification, and requiring 
                your acceptance of updated terms for continued use. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes 
                acceptance of the modified terms.
            </p>

            <h2 id="tos-general">General Provisions</h2>
            
            <h3 id="entire-agreement">Entire Agreement</h3>

            <h3 id="severability">Severability</h3>
            <p>If any provision of these terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in effect.</p>

            <h3 id="no-waiver">No Waiver</h3>
            <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

            <h3 id="assignment">Assignment</h3>
            <p>You may not assign or transfer these terms without our written consent. We may assign these terms without restriction.</p>
