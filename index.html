            <h2 id="overview">Welcome</h2>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, protect, and share 
                your personal information when you use our mobile application and related services. 
                This policy explains what data we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, 
                and your rights regarding your information.
            </p>

            <h2 id="about-secrecy">About Secrecy</h2>
            <p>
                Secrecy is an application that allows you to securely encrypt content on your device
                and share it via any external app of your choice. All encryption and storage happens 
                locally on your device. We DO NOT store your encrypted secrets, they remain exclusively 
                on your device. We only store your account information (email, name), your public 
                key for user discovery, and device information to protect your account from unauthorized access.
            </p>
            
            <p>Secrecy provides:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Encryption:</strong> Encrypt content (secrets, notes, messages) on your 
                    device using public key cryptography
                </li>
                <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All your encrypted secrets are stored exclusively on 
                    your device, never uploaded to our servers
                </li>
                <li><strong>Public Key Infrastructure:</strong> Each user has a public/private key pair. 
                    You encrypt content using someone's public key, and only their private key can decrypt it
                </li>
                <li><strong>External Sharing:</strong> Share encrypted content through any installed app 
                    on your device using the application share feature or any other mechanism of your choice.
                </li>
                <li><strong>User Directory:</strong> Find other users by username to obtain their public 
                    keys for encryption
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All your secrets remain on your device. We never have access to your private keys 
                or encrypted content.
            </p>

            <h2 id="information-collect">Information We Collect</h2>
            
            <h3 id="info-provide">Information You Provide</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, 
                    we collect your email address and name to identify you and make 
                    your account unique among others. This will help you manage your account 
                    on different devices of your choice. Your profile information, such as name and bio, 
                    can be shared with others to allow other users to make connection requests with you and
                    maintain relationships and public key discovery. For instance, you can choose a privacy
                    option via menu view, and if your account is set to public, then any user can see your profile
                    including your full name, bio, and unique username of your account, and they can send a 
                    friend request to you. If your account is set
                    to private, then any user can discover your profile and can see your full name, bio, and unique username 
                    of your account, but they cannot discover your public key for content encryption for you. 
                    They should be in your friend list in order to discover your public key. 
                    Therefore, they can encrypt content and share it with you. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="info-auto">Automatically Collected Information</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Device Information:</strong> When you create an account, your device ID will be
                    used for security purposes to help protect your account from unauthorized access. For instance,
                    when you are logged into your account on a device, if someone logs in using your account credentials 
                    on any other device then your device ID will be used to identify your currently active session on
                    your device. Therefore, we can notify you regarding unauthorized access to your account and can block that attempt
                    to access your account on a new device. Therefore, an account can only be logged into one device at a time. You cannot
                    use your account on multiple devices at the same time.
                </li>
                <li><strong>App Activity:</strong> Login timestamps for security purposes. Your login activity, 
                    for instance, which device you log into and timestamp, helps us to protect your account 
                    from unauthorized activities on your account. You can access this information via the application
                    so you will know on which devices your account has been logged into and used.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Public Keys:</strong> Your public encryption keys (used by others to encrypt 
                    content for you). Your private keys remain on your device and are never collected or 
                    transmitted. Public keys are public. They will not harm you! Public keys are used 
                    to encrypt content for you. Therefore, you can decrypt the content using your private 
                    key stored on your device when you receive it. You can rotate your keys occasionally so your 
                    public key and private key will be changed. When you rotate your keys, your new public key 
                    will be stored on our servers and replace the old one, while your old private key is replaced 
                    by the new private key on your device. All your existing encrypted content is automatically 
                    re-encrypted with the new key to ensure you don't lose access to your data.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="info-not-collect">What We DON'T Collect</h3>
            <p>
                We do NOT collect or store your encrypted secrets, notes, messages, or 
                any content you encrypt on your device. All your encrypted content 
                remains exclusively on your device. Feel free to encrypt content and 
                confidently share it with others using any applications installed on 
                your device. 
            </p>

            <h2 id="how-we-use">How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>
                When you create an account, you can verify your identity by authenticating using your email
                and password. Once you are authenticated, you will be subject to two-step verification 
                as you should verify your login via a second method added to protect your account from 
                unauthorized access. A one-time OTP code will be sent to your email so you can use it 
                to verify and access and manage your account. Your information (email) will be used 
                for authentication and account verification purposes, such as sending login verification codes 
                and account-related security notifications.
            </p>
            <p>
                We store your public keys to enable other users to encrypt content for you. Therefore, you 
                can decrypt the content using your private key stored only on your device. Your public key 
                can be discovered by other users based on your privacy settings. If you set your privacy 
                to public then any user can discover your public key and can encrypt content for you. 
                If you set your privacy to private then no one can discover your public key other than 
                the users (friends) connected with you already.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your information (name) enables other users to find you and make connections with you as well as 
                allowing you to find other users by using their information (name) and make connections with them. Your information 
                (bio) is optional and is used for your profile to showcase your identity with others.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can only use your account on one device at a time. 
                If you want to change your device then your session on the previous 
                device will be revoked. For this purpose, we collect your device information 
                to keep track of whether your login session is active on a single device.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not route your encrypted content (secrets, notes, messages, or any other) through 
                our servers. You may share them via any application installed on your device with
                confidence as they cannot recover the original content from the encrypted blob. 
            </p>

            <h2 id="encryption">How Encryption Works</h2>
            <p>
                When you create an account, a new public/private key pair will be generated and stored on your 
                device. Only the public key will be sent to our servers for user discovery. Your private key remains 
                only on your device. All content is encrypted and stored locally on your device using your private 
                key.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your encrypted content NEVER leaves your device except when you manually share it via external 
                apps. You can only encrypt content for yourself using your public key. Therefore, no one can decrypt 
                it as they do not have access to your private key. When you encrypt content for other users, 
                you cannot decrypt the content as you do not have access to their private key.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use industry-standard encryption: AES-256-GCM and X25519 (ECDH).
            </p>
            <p>
                We never have access to your encrypted content since it never reaches our servers. If you lose 
                your device or private key (by clearing app cache or data), we cannot recover your encrypted data. 
                You will lose your encrypted information entirely as it cannot be recovered in any other way.
            </p>

            <h2 id="sharing">How We Disclose Your Information</h2>
            <p><strong>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties</strong>, except:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Supabase as a service provider is used to provide 
                    authentication and database hosting. They have their own 
                    <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">privacy policy</a>. They only have access to 
                    your account information (email, username, full name, bio, public keys, device ID). 
                    They do NOT have access to your private keys or encrypted secrets. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law, court order, or government 
                    regulation, we can share your information such as email, username, full name, bio, public keys 
                    or device ID as we only store these on our servers. We cannot share your private key or 
                    any of your encrypted content stored on your device as we do NOT store this information on our
                    servers.
                </li>
                <li><strong>User-Initiated Sharing:</strong> When you explicitly share encrypted secrets 
                    via external apps such as instant messaging apps, email clients, or any other applications, 
                    you provide consent for your data sharing. We are not collecting any of your content sharing 
                    information via other applications. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="retention">Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
                While your account remains active and you continue to use Secrecy, we retain your account 
                information (email, username, full name, bio, public key, device ID, connection lists, and 
                login timestamps) on our servers. This information is essential for maintaining your account 
                functionality, enabling user discovery, facilitating secure connections with other users, and 
                protecting your account from unauthorized access. Your account data will be retained indefinitely 
                as long as your account is active and you continue to use our services.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you request to delete your account, we initiate a 30-day grace period to protect you from 
                accidental or unauthorized deletion. During this grace period, your account enters a "disabled 
                state" where your profile becomes invisible to other users, your public key cannot be discovered 
                by others, and all your data remains on our servers but is marked for deletion. You can cancel 
                the deletion request and recover your account at any time during this period by simply logging 
                in again using your email and password. Logging in will automatically cancel the deletion request 
                and restore your account to its active state. After the 30-day grace period expires, all your 
                server-stored data (email, username, full name, bio, public key, device ID, connections, and login 
                history) will be permanently and completely removed from our servers. This deletion is irreversible, 
                and you will not be able to recover your account or any associated data after this point.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your encrypted secrets (notes, messages, and any other encrypted content) are stored exclusively 
                on your device and are completely under your control. We have no access to this data and cannot 
                delete it remotely. You can manage and delete your encrypted content at any time directly through 
                the app. You can delete individual secrets by removing specific encrypted items one by one, clear 
                all data by using the app settings to delete all encrypted content at once, or remove all encrypted 
                data by uninstalling the app from your device. Using your device settings to clear Secrecy's app 
                data will permanently delete all encrypted content and your private keys. If you clear app data, 
                cache, or uninstall the app, your encrypted content and private keys will be permanently lost and 
                cannot be recovered—even if your account remains active on our servers. Always ensure you have 
                securely backed up any important information before clearing app data or uninstalling.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you rotate your encryption keys (change your public/private key pair), your new public key 
                is immediately stored on our servers and replaces your old public key. The old public key is not 
                retained. Your old private key is replaced by the new private key and is not stored on your device. 
                To ensure you don't lose access to your existing encrypted data, all content that was encrypted with 
                your old key is automatically re-encrypted with your new key during the key rotation process. This 
                means you can continue to access all your encrypted content without any data loss after key rotation.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you disconnect from another user (remove them from your friends list), the connection record 
                is immediately deleted from our servers. However, any encrypted content you previously shared with 
                that user remains on your device and their device until manually deleted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your login history (login timestamps and device information) is retained for security monitoring 
                purposes as long as your account is active. This helps you track which devices have accessed your 
                account and when. When you delete your account, all login history is permanently removed within 
                the 30-day deletion period.
            </p>

            <h2 id="rights">How to Control Your Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                We believe you should have complete control over your personal information. Secrecy provides 
                you with comprehensive privacy controls and rights to manage your data both on our servers 
                and on your device.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can view and access all account-related data we store on our servers at any time. This 
                includes your email, username, full name, bio, public key, device ID, connection list, and 
                login history with timestamps. You can access this information directly through the app 
                settings or by contacting us to request a comprehensive data report. We will provide your 
                data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format within 30 days of your request.
            </p>
            <p>
                You have the right to delete your account and all associated server data at any time without 
                providing any reason. When you initiate account deletion through the app settings, your account 
                immediately enters a "disabled state" where your profile becomes invisible to all other users, 
                other users cannot discover your public key or send you connection requests, and all your 
                connections (friends) will see your account as "Deleted" or unavailable. You have a 30-day grace 
                period to recover your account if you change your mind. To cancel the deletion request and recover 
                your account during the grace period, simply log in again using your email and password. Logging in 
                will automatically cancel the deletion request and restore your account to its active state. After 
                30 days, all your server-stored data is permanently and irreversibly deleted. Account deletion only 
                removes data stored on our servers. Your encrypted content and private keys stored on your device 
                remain on your device until you manually delete them through the app or clear the app data.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can request a complete copy of your account information at any time. To export your data, 
                email us with your request (contact details are provided in the <a href="#contact">Contact Us</a> 
                section below). We will provide you with a downloadable file containing your account information 
                (email, username, full name, bio), your public key, your device ID, your connection list (friends), 
                your login history with timestamps, and account creation date and last modification dates. The 
                exported data will be in JSON format, which can be easily read and processed. We will deliver your 
                data export within 30 days of your request.
            </p>
            <p>
                You have the right to update and correct your profile information at any time to ensure it remains 
                accurate and up-to-date. You can update your display name shown to other users, modify your profile 
                description visible to others, switch between public and private account visibility, and change your 
                account password for security purposes directly through the app. Some information cannot be changed 
                after account creation, including your username and email address, as they serve as your unique 
                identifiers in the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                You have full control over who can connect with you and access your public key. You can accept 
                or reject connection requests from other users, remove existing connections (friends) at any time, 
                set your account to private to restrict public key discovery to friends only, or set your account to public to allow 
                anyone to discover your public key.
            </p>
            <p>
                You have complete control over your encryption keys. You can generate new public/private key pairs 
                at any time for enhanced security. Your private keys remain exclusively on your device and are 
                never transmitted. While we don't provide cloud backup for private keys (for security reasons), 
                you can manually export and securely store them. When you rotate your keys, your old private key is 
                replaced by the new private key, and all your existing encrypted content is automatically re-encrypted 
                with the new key. This ensures you don't lose access to any of your data after key rotation.
            </p>
            <p>
                You have full control over all encrypted content stored on your device. You can view all your 
                encrypted secrets, notes, and messages stored locally, delete individual encrypted items whenever 
                you want, and control which apps you share encrypted content with. Your device data is completely independent of your server account. You can delete local data without 
                affecting your account, and vice versa.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can withdraw your consent to data processing at any time by deleting your account. Once you 
                delete your account, we will cease all processing of your personal data and permanently remove it 
                from our servers within 30 days. This is your right under GDPR and CCPA regulations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, we only send emails for essential authentication and account verification purposes, such 
                as login verification codes (OTP) and account-related security notifications. We do not send push 
                notifications or marketing emails. These essential authentication and security emails 
                cannot be disabled as they are necessary for account security and access.

            <h2 id="children">Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                Protecting children's privacy is extremely important to us. Secrecy is designed for users 
                aged 13 years and older. We do not knowingly collect, use, store, or share personal information 
                from children under the age of 13 years. Our app is not directed toward children, and we do not 
                intend to collect any information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you create an account, you affirm that you are at least 13 years old. While we don't 
                explicitly verify age during account creation, we rely on users to provide accurate information 
                about their eligibility to use the service.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are a parent or guardian and you become aware that your child under the age of 13 has 
                created an account or provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact 
                us immediately (contact details are provided in the <a href="#contact">Contact Us</a> section below). 
                We will take prompt action to verify the age of the account holder, immediately suspend the account 
                if the user is confirmed to be under 13, permanently delete all personal information associated with 
                that account from our servers, and notify you once the account and data have been removed.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the 
                United States and similar child protection laws in other jurisdictions. If we become aware that we 
                have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that 
                information as quickly as possible.

            <h2 id="international">International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>
                Secrecy is a global application that can be used by users around the world. To provide our 
                services to you regardless of your location, your account information may be transferred to, 
                stored in, and processed in countries outside your country of residence. This is necessary to 
                maintain our services and ensure you can access your account from anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use Supabase as our backend service provider, which hosts our database infrastructure on 
                Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers. These servers may be located in various countries and regions, 
                including but not limited to the United States, European Union, and other jurisdictions. The 
                specific location of data storage depends on Supabase's infrastructure configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Different countries have different data protection laws, and the country where your data is stored 
                may have different privacy protections than your home country. However, we ensure that regardless 
                of where your data is stored, we apply the same high standards of data protection and security 
                measures described in this Privacy Policy to all user data. For users in the European Economic 
                Area (EEA), United Kingdom, and Switzerland, we ensure that any international data transfers 
                comply with GDPR requirements, including the use of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved 
                by the European Commission. All data transmitted between your device and our servers (regardless 
                of location) is encrypted using TLS/HTTPS, protecting it from interception during transfer. Your 
                data stored on servers is protected with industry-standard encryption and access controls, 
                regardless of the server's physical location. Our service providers (like Supabase and AWS) are 
                contractually obligated to maintain appropriate security measures and comply with applicable data 
                protection laws, including GDPR and CCPA.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's important to note that your encrypted secrets, notes, and messages are never transferred 
                internationally because they never leave your device. Only your account information (email, name, 
                bio, public keys) and metadata (device ID, login timestamps) are stored on our servers and may be 
                subject to international transfer.
            </p>
            <p>
                In some cases, law enforcement or government authorities in the country where data is stored may 
                have the legal right to access data stored on servers in their jurisdiction. However, we can only 
                provide access to account information stored on our servers—we cannot provide access to your 
                encrypted content or private keys because we don't have them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless of where your data is stored or processed, you retain all the rights described in this 
                Privacy Policy, including the right to access, correct, export, and delete your data.
            </p>

            <h2 id="third-party">Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
                To provide our services, we rely on certain third-party service providers who process your 
                account information on our behalf. We carefully select service providers that maintain high 
                standards of security and privacy, and we ensure they only access the minimum data necessary 
                to perform their functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Supabase Inc. is a backend-as-a-service platform that provides database hosting and authentication 
                infrastructure. We use Supabase to provide critical functions including authentication that handles 
                user account creation, login, password management, and two-factor authentication via email OTP; 
                database hosting that stores your account information (email, username, full name, bio, public keys, 
                device ID, connections, login timestamps); security features that provide row-level security policies 
                and access controls to protect your data; and infrastructure management that handles server 
                infrastructure, backups, and ensures high availability of our services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Supabase has access only to the account information and metadata stored on their servers, which includes 
                your email address, username, full name, and bio, your public encryption keys (not private keys), your 
                device ID and login timestamps, and your connection list (friends). Supabase cannot access your encrypted 
                secrets, notes, or messages (stored only on your device), your private encryption keys (never leave your 
                device), content you share via external apps, or any data encrypted on your device.
            </p>
            <p>
                Supabase uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its underlying cloud infrastructure provider. This means your 
                data is ultimately stored on AWS servers, which are subject to AWS security policies and data center 
                protections. Supabase has its own privacy policy that governs how they handle data. You can review their 
                privacy practices at:

            </p>
            <p>
                Supabase implements industry-standard security measures including encryption in transit (TLS/HTTPS), 
                encryption at rest for stored data, regular security audits and penetration testing, compliance with 
                SOC 2 Type II standards, and GDPR and CCPA compliance. Supabase acts as a "data processor" on our 
                behalf, meaning they process your data only according to our instructions and for the purposes we 
                specify. They are contractually prohibited from using your data for their own purposes or sharing it 
                with other parties without authorization.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your data may be stored on Supabase/AWS servers in various regions worldwide. For more information 
                about data location and international transfers, see the "International Data Transfers" section above.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from Supabase/AWS, we do not share your personal information with any other third-party services, 
                analytics providers, advertising networks, or data brokers. We do not use tracking pixels, third-party 
                cookies, or analytics services that collect your data. Your encrypted content never passes through any 
                third-party services, it remains exclusively on your device.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we ever add new third-party service providers or change our existing providers, we will update this 
                Privacy Policy and notify you according to the process described in the "Changes to This Privacy Policy" 
                section above.

                We are committed to complying with all applicable privacy laws and regulations in the

            </p>
            <p>
                For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, and Switzerland, we comply with 
                General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements, including lawful basis for data processing 
                (consent and legitimate interests), data minimization, collecting only necessary information, right 
                to access, rectification, erasure, and data portability, right to restrict processing and object to 
                processing, data protection by design and by default, secure international data transfers using 
                Standard Contractual Clauses, and breach notification within 72 hours when required.

                For California residents, we comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California 
                Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), providing right to know what personal information we collect, right to 
                delete personal information, right to opt-out of sale (note: we do not sell personal information), 
                right to non-discrimination for exercising privacy rights, right to correct inaccurate information, 
                and right to limit use of sensitive personal information.

                We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by not knowingly collecting 
                personal information from children under 13 years of age. Our service is not directed at children, 
                and we take immediate action to delete any data if we discover it belongs to a child under 13.
            </p>

                We adhere to Google Play's data safety requirements, including transparent disclosure of data 
                collection and usage practices, secure data handling and transmission, user consent for data 
                collection where required, compliance with restricted permissions policies, and data deletion and 
                retention policies.
            </p>
            <p>
                We request only the minimum necessary device permissions required for our app to function. Internet 
                access is required to communicate with our servers for authentication and user discovery. The app 
                stores encrypted content in protected storage on your device without requiring storage permissions. 
                We do NOT request unnecessary permissions such as location, camera, microphone, contacts, storage, 
                or SMS access.
            </p>
            <p>
                We follow recognized security frameworks and best practices including NIST Cybersecurity Framework 
                guidelines, OWASP Mobile Application Security standards, industry-standard encryption algorithms 
                (AES-256-GCM, X25519), secure key storage using Android Keystore, and regular security assessments 
                and updates.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may be required to disclose user information in response to valid legal requests from law 
                enforcement agencies or government authorities, such as court orders, search warrants, 
                national security requests, and other legally binding requests. In such cases, we will only provide 
                the minimum information required by law, which is limited to account information stored on our servers 
                (email, username, name, bio, public keys, device ID, login timestamps). We cannot provide encrypted 
                content or private keys because we don't have access to them. Where legally permitted, we will notify 
                you of such requests unless prohibited by law or court order.

            <h2 id="changes">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
                As our app evolves and privacy laws change, we may need to update this Privacy Policy from 
                time to time to reflect changes in our practices, services, legal requirements, or for other 
                operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We are committed to keeping you informed about any 
                changes to how we collect, use, and protect your personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you through multiple channels to 
                ensure you're aware of the updates. We will always update the "Effective" and "Last updated" 
                dates at the top of this Privacy Policy to reflect when the changes take effect and when they 
                were last modified. For significant or material changes that affect how we collect, use, or 
                share your personal information, we will send you an in-app notification when you next open the 
                app. This notification will provide a summary of the key changes and direct you to the full 
                updated policy. For major changes that substantially affect your privacy rights or data handling 
                practices, we will also send an email notification to the email address associated with your 
                account. This email will explain the changes and how they impact you. For material changes that 
                significantly alter your rights or our data practices, we may require you to review and accept 
                the updated Privacy Policy before you can continue using the app. You will be presented with the 
                updated policy and asked to explicitly agree to the new terms. We maintain previous versions of 
                our Privacy Policy so you can review what has changed over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                We distinguish between different types of policy updates. Minor changes include small updates 
                such as clarifications, typo corrections, or formatting improvements that don't affect your rights 
                or our practices. These changes only require updating the "Last updated" date. Significant changes 
                are updates that modify our data collection, usage, or sharing practices in meaningful ways. These 
                changes trigger in-app notifications. Material changes are substantial modifications that 
                significantly affect your privacy rights, such as collecting new types of data, sharing data with 
                new third parties, or changing data retention periods. These changes require email notification 
                and may require your explicit acceptance.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that you disagree with, you have several options.
